description: Core repo rules for ChunkFlow. Always apply these.
globs:
  - "**/*"
---

Follow the repo's CLAUDE.md as the source of truth.

Behavior:
- Prefer minimal diffs; do not refactor unrelated code.
- If you need to add tooling (npm, eslint, jest, etc.), ask first and justify.
- Always explain: what changed, files touched, and how to manually verify.

Output after changes:
- Summary
- Files touched
- Manual test steps (Chrome MV3 load/reload)
- Risks / follow-ups
