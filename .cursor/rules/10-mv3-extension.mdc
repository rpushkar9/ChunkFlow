Chrome Extension MV3 notes:
- background.js is a service worker and may unload when idle; avoid relying on long-lived in-memory state.
- Prefer message-passing patterns and chrome.storage for persistence if needed.
- No build step: changes take effect after reloading extension in chrome://extensions.

When editing:
- Keep changes local to the requested behavior.
- Preserve existing naming + patterns in background/content/popup.
